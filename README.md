## RFID Authentication 

This is project is based on RFID for authentication. It shows the application of RFID technology technology 
in a very ideal situation where every devices has embedded high frequency RFID 13MHz and the owner has a low frequency
RFID card to verify the other.   


### Hardware

#### MFRC522

 1. RFID-Key Ring ![Key ring Image](https://github.com/EricoDeMecha/Pi_RFID-Based_security/blob/master/assets/key_ring.jpg)
  125KHz
  
 2. RFID card ![card](https://github.com/EricoDeMecha/Pi_RFID-Based_security/blob/master/assets/card.jpeg)
 13Mhz
 
 3. RFID reader ![reader](https://github.com/EricoDeMecha/Pi_RFID-Based_security/blob/master/assets/reader.jpg)
 
 ### Ideal situation 

 * Provide information to be stored in the card.
 * Write the information digitally to the card.
 * Detect the high frequency card.
 * Verify the high frequency card by swiping the low frequency card on the reader.
